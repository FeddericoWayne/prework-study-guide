# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to keep a record of what I've learned at the bootcamp, so that I may refer back to it when I come across coding issues in the future.
This project is also an organized way to help future coding students access important tips on the three main coding languages taught at bootcamp: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
By separating the page into different sections, each dedicated to a topic/coding language, viewers can easily skip to whichever topic they like, thus avoiding extra time wasted on searching for the information they need.

## Usage

This webpage is divided into four main sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 
Scroll up and down the page to read the information in each section. When necessary, I included examples in case the definition of a term is too abstract for beginners to undertand.
