        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start a webpage with the declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; to let the browser know what to expect for this webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The header element is not to be confused with the head element. The header element is part of the body element, and its purpose is to identify the content that precedes the primary content (the main and footer elements) of the webpage</li>
          <li>The footer element is at the bottom of the body element, and usually contains info such as copyright, author, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>The title element lives inside the head element, and defines the title for a webpage, which is important for SEO</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource (including text/css files) to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The metadata of a webpage is always located inside the head element, in the meta element</li>
          <li>Common attributes of the meta element include: character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>You can insert comments for other website developers by enclosing the message in <br> &lt;! -- YOUR COMMENT --&gt;, comments will only be visible in source code and will not be rendered by the browser</li>
          <li>The &lt;br&gt; element is an empty element that creates a line break</li>
          <li>Every html element can have an id attribute</li>
          <li>The &lt;a&gt; element creates a link (anchor) to the same page or other pages, and must include the actual URL link as an attribute. For example: &lt;a href="URL"&gt;.<br>Links to certain sections on same page can be expressed as &lt;a href=#id&gt;</li>
          <li>The &lt;img&gt; element is for images, and must include the attributes of: src (source), alt (alt text), width, and height (in pixels)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS info can be anywhere in the html file by using the style attribute with a CSS rule. <br>For example: &lt;h1 style= "color:red;"&gt;h1&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
          <li>Internal and external CSS info sit inside the head of the HTML page</li>
          <li>External CSS files must be linked to the html page in the head element.<br>For example: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./asset/style.css"  type="text/css"&gt;</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Padding sits around the element, and border sits around the padding, and margin sits around border</li>
          <li>Increasing the padding of an element effectively increases the entire element</li>
          <li>Using margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto together centeres the element</li>
          <li>Padding-left can be used to control indentation (for &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;, for example)</li>
          <li>Font-size can be used since default font size is 16px</li>
          <li>Use the asterisk symbol * as universal selector targeting all the elements</li>
          <li>Use commas to separate different elements you want to select in the selector. For example: header, footer or h1, h2</li>
          <li>Use the period symbol . followed by class name to select a elements that carry the same class attribute</li>
          <li>Color indicates the text color of the element, while background-color indicates the backdrop color of the element</li>
          <li>For img selector, display: block will make sure the image starts on a new line</li>
          <li>The text-align property can be used to specify text alignment (center, right, left, justify)</li>
          <li>Border thickness and color can be controlled in pixels and color name or code. For example: {border: 5px solid grey;}</li>
          <li>Box-shadow property customizes outside of the border and the value format is: X px Y px #color_code. <br>For example: {box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888;} creates a light grey box shadow that's 5px horizontally and 10px vertically</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Common Git Commands:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks which branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b "branch-name": creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages all changes for the branch for commits</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: checks to see if your local branch is up to date with the origin's main branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m"message": confirms the changes to be pushed onto Github with a message that describes the changes</li>
          <li>git push origin "new-branch": syncs the new branch with Github</li>
          <li>git branch -d branch_name deletes a branch. Git will not let you delete the branch you're currently checking out, so make sure you check out another branch (for example, main) before running this git command</li>
          <li>git branch -d branch_name will not let you delete a branch until it's commited and pushed. If you need to delete a branch that hasn't been commited and pushed, run this git command: git branch -D branch_name</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>link Javascript files at the <strong>bottom of the body element</strong> with the script element like so: &lt;script src = "file location"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values, and you can name your variable almost anything. Use semicolons to separate statements</li>
          <li>JavaScripts are run by the computer from top to bottom</li>
          <li>Declare a variable by typing var, followed by the variable name. To assign values to variables, follow with &ldquo;=&rdquo; + value.<br>For example: var MyVarialbe = 'Bob'. Retrive values by calling variable names.</li>
          <li>Code blocks are placed in curly brackets</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive</li>
          <li>End each line in JacaScript with a semicolon</li>
          <li>Different types of JavaScript data:
            <ol>
              <li>String: a sequence of text. For example: let MyVariable = 'Bob'</li>
              <li>Number: numbers do not need quote marks</li>
              <li>Boolean: true or false. Also doesn't need quote marks</li>
              <li>Array: this allows us to store multiple values in a single reference.<br>For example: let MyVariable = [1, 'bob', 'steve', 10]. When calling a variable value in an array, use the index number, which is the position of the data in the array, with the first item being index [0]. For example: MyVariable[0], MyVariablew[1], MyVariable[2], etc. The index number of an array is not to be confused with the length of the array. The length of the array is the number of items in the array, while the first item in an array has the index number of 0.</li>
              <li>Object: this can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. For example: let MyVariable = document.querySelector('h1')</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>There are two categories of JavaScript values
          <ol><b>Primitive Values: immutable datum</b>
            <li>Boolean Type: true or false</li>
            <li>Null Type: null, intentional absence of value</li>
            <li>Undefined Type: any variable that hasn't been assigned a value</li>
            <li>Number Type</li>
            <li>BitInt Type</li>
            <li>String Type: textual data</li>
            <li>Symbol Type</li>
          </ol>
          <ol><b>Objects</b></ol>
            <li>An object is a value in memory that is referenced by an identifier</li>
          </li>
          <li>Insert comments in one of these two ways: /* YOUR COMMENT */  or  // YOUR COMMENT</li>
          <li>Operators are math symbols that produce results based on two values:
            <ol>
              <li>Addition: +</li>
              <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: -, *, /</li>
              <li>Assignment: =</li>
              <li>Strict Equality - True or False (Boolean results): ===</li>
              <li>Not, Does Not Equal: ! or !==. Used to test if two values are not equal</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or false</li>
            <li>Functions are packaged functionality that you wish to reuse. For example: a body of codes that are run when you call on the function name, and they are followed by parentheses</li>
          </li>
          <li>Events: real interactivity on a website requires event handlers: code structures that listen for activity in the brower and run codes in response. For example: the click event</li>
          <li>Variants can be assigned and re-assigned any value and any type of value</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Common JavaScript Methods and Functions:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Console.log(variable name): a method used to output messages to browser consoles and to test codes. Note that the variable names we put inside the parentheses are called Arguments</li>
            <li>Conditional: if (var = X) { run code A; } else if (var = Y) { run code B; } else { run code C; }</li>
            <li>"++" is equal to "+1". For example: X++ means X+1</li>
            <li>The built-in property "length" allows you to run for loops that depends on the length of your array. For example: variableName.length</li>
            <li>"For loops" start with "for", follow by a three-part conditional sentences enclosed in parentheses, and then by a code block enclosed in curly brackets. For example: for(varName X = 0; X < varName.length; X++) { Code Block } This will loop the code multiple times, with X incrementing by 1 after each loop, as long as X is smaller than the length of the variant</li>
